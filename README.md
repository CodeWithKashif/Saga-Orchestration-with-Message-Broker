# Saga-Orchestration-with-Message-Broker
Distributed Transaction - Saga Orchestration Pattern implementation with Message Broker (RabbitMQ)


**Overview**
Saga-Orchestration-with-Message-Broker is a comprehensive solution for orchestrating distributed
transactions in microservices architectures using RabbitMQ. It ensures data consistency, fault tolerance,
and reliable communication across complex workflows involving multiple interconnected services.

core features include:
*Distributed Transaction Management: Coordinates multi-service workflows to maintain data
integrity.

**Fault Tolerance:** Implements robust mechanisms to handle failures and ensure system resilience.
Asynchronous Messaging: Uses RabbitMQ for decoupled, reliable event-driven communication.
**Workflow Orchestration:** Manages complex business processes like customer, vehicle, and
workshop management seamlessly.
**Configurable & Extensible:** Supports flexible deployment and integration within microservices
ecosystems.
**High Scalability:** Designed for scalable, resilient microservice orchestration.
